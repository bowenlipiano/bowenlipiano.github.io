            Bowen has experience teaching students of all levels and has developed specialized programs for each level. His teaching methods are individualized to suit the needs and goals of each student. Here are some notes on what to expect from lessons at each stage.

            <p> </p>

            <div id= "bolden"> Beginner students /
Suggested lesson length: 30-45 minutes </div> <p> </p>
Bowen’s teaching method for beginners does away with the monotony and rigidity of method books. Instead, he uses an original method that is inspired by leading theories on music education, such as Music Learning Theory and Dalcroze Eurhythmics. By using a mixture of games, activities and traditional repertoire learning, children can learn music in a way that is not only fun and interactive, but also clear and effective.


<p> </p>
<div id= "bolden"> Intermediate students /
Suggested lesson length: 45-60 minutes </div><p> </p>
Lessons at this stage focused on further developing the foundational skills learned in the beginner period. Students will learn to master the basic skills of rhythm, note reading, musical expression, and basic music theory. Bowen will also teach the foundations of how to develop a virtuosic technique that is healthy, comfortable, and easy.

<p> </p>
<div id= "bolden"> Advanced students /
Suggested lesson length: 1 hour or more </div> <p> </p>
At this level, Bowen teaches students the most sophisticated techniques that are required to manage difficult passagework and tonal control. Students will not only learn how to fully understand musical construction and how to effectively interpret repertoire, but how to do so while maintaining their own individuality and unique voice. Bowen coaches students on to fully manifest their own musical ideas so that playing piano always remains a means of self-expression rather than a tiresome exercise of following arbitrary rules.
<p> </p>

<div id="bolden"> Adult students /
Suggested lesson length 45-60 minutes </div> <p> </p>
For adult learners, Bowen always tailors his teaching methods to their goals and interests. Whether a student has prior experience with piano or music in general, or is just starting out, Bowen always guides them towards what they want to accomplish. This could be learning classical repertoire, pop song renditions, improvisation, composition or any combination of these.

<p> </p>

Bowen not only trains his students so they can succeed in whatever exams and competitions they may participate in, but so that they can develop a sense of confidence and competency that will allow them to maintain music as a lifelong passion.
